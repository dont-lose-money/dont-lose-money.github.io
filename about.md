This is a Mission Statement and brief description of our fund management theory.

Our analysis staff appears to be an eccentric collection of nut case persons, that have no other life than trading the financial markets: they live, sleep, and dream the financial markets with 100% total concentration to this one pursuit.

Following marking behavior, their noses are on the trail of the financial elephants and gorillas, feeding on the financial carnage left behind by the powers driving the markets.

To become a master at any pursuit requires this total commitment and concentration.  In any athletic, artistic, scientific, or business pursuit, the most accomplished persons live the endeavor they have chosen.  Our market analysts trading involvement is not a "job", with office hours, but a life and lifestyle dedicated to being on the leading edge of the market condition at any point in time, day or night, weekday or weekend.

The world financial market business hours are every hour of every day and are moved most dramatically by unforeseen events and at unpredictable times.  Most fund managers live a normal life with a social component for family and business relationships, but the distraction of those social obligations is what weakens the performance of the "institutional" fund managers, often they are not paying attention when the shit hits the fan.

The 21st century's financial world requires constant monitoring and a consistent trading plan set in place to cope with a variety of market scenarios.  We provide 100% attention to the funds we manage, our analysts are obsessed with market action.  They live the market and so benefit most from trading in the market environment.

Years of experience have taught our analysis to recognize where the elephants and gorillas are moving and to follow their train in the financial jungle.  We let the market talk to us rather than imposing our opinion about the market to explain market action.  We are always listening to the actions of the market, frequently when other fund managers are sleeping.

Bottom line, we really make money the old fashion way, by busting our butts and being 100% committed to doing the best possible work.

Thanks,

The Staff of Negative Research
